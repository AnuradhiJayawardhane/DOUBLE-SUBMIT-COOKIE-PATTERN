# DOUBLE-SUBMIT-COOKIE-PATTERN

The double-submit cookie pattern protection against cross-site request forgeries (CSRF) is a popular option in stateless applications as it doesn't require the server to store a token value between requests. Instead, the server will verify a token value stored in a cookie against a request parameter

STEPS TO TEST:
 1.Clone or download this repository.
 2.Extract it in to the localhost directory. (ex: if you use XAMPP, then copy files into the xampp's htdocs folder)
 3.Start hosting and go to the index.php page.
 4.Use "admin" for both usename and password.
